# Correlation Between Economic Growth and Economic Freedom

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between economic growth and economic freedom using Human Development Index and GDP Per-Capita data. The analysis with the main data processing and visualization is done in the `project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to determine if there is a significant correlation between the economic freedom of countries and their economic growth rates.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x** - You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Jupyter Lab** - For running the Jupyter Notebook file (`project.ipynb`).

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Lab:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open the `project.ipynb` file in Jupyter Lab to view and run the analysis.

## Analysis Summary

The `project.ipynb` notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Data Import**: Retrieves data from relevant sources and loads it into the environment.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, formats data, and prepares it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes the data to identify trends and patterns.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculates the correlation between economic growth and economic freedom indicators.
5. **Results**: Presents the findings, showing whether a significant correlation exists between the variables.

### Example Results

- The correlation analysis indicates a moderate positive relationship between economic freedom and economic growth, suggesting that countries with higher economic freedom tend to have higher growth rates.
